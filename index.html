                Here is an organisation of all lore-related media from Whitepine, the information obtained from
                them, and how the aforementioned information was obtained. Some images / videos are not kept here as we
                haven't found them to contain any tasty information, and they would be too large to store. Contact <a

                    As mentioned before, the 4<sup>th</sup> was a video, so instead linked above is a frame.
                    Again, the 10<sup>th</sup> was never found, and the 6<sup>th</sup> was accompanied by an <a
                        href="https://x.com/TheEmbertonWire" target="_blank"><i
                            class='bx bxl-twitter'></i>&nbsp;Emberton Wire</a> post. Again,

            </div>
            <h3>secret message &#128273;</h3>
            <p>
                If you increase the exposure on all these images (which is done in the edited versions), you will see
                some hidden characters. From the 3<sup>rd</sup> to the 8<sup>th</sup>, you will also see some characters
                on signs. The characters on signs are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>3<sup>rd</sup>: <code>ywcwy</code></li>
                <li>4<sup>th</sup>: <code>oohio</code></li>
                <li>5<sup>th</sup>: <code>unalu</code></li>
                <li>6<sup>th</sup>: <code>&nbsp;tnl</code></li>
                <li>7<sup>th</sup>: <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;g</code></li>
                <li>8<sup>th</sup>: <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;e</code></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="box">
                <i class='bx bx-info-circle'></i>
                <p>
                    The 8<sup>th</sup> day's sign character is actually not on a sign, but in the clearing on the left
                    of the image, just below the vertical middle. However, it uses the same font as a character on a
                    sign would.
                </p>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully arranged like that it's easier to see the pattern - they spell out
                <code>you wont change will you</code>, when arranged like so.
            </p>
            <h3>secret video '1' &#129323;</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of the other characters on the
                images, when arranged linearly you get <code>3qw99S3e-*k</code>, with the asterix for the
                missing 10<sup>th</sup> day. This points to the secret video titled <a

            <p>
                This post contained an image of an article from a newspaper - The Emberton Wire. The article is titled
                <b>NOBLEMANS NEW EXPIDETION</b>. On the left of the newspaper name is a faint <code>@</code>, and upon
                searching online, a Twitter account named <a href="https://twitter.com/TheEmbertonWire"
                    target="_blank"><i class='bx bxl-twitter'></i>&nbsp;The Emberton Wire</a> was found. This is
                confirmed to be correct, as there is a <a
                    href="https://x.com/TheEmbertonWire/status/1820878019713474709" target="_blank"><i
                        class='bx bx-link-external'></i>&nbsp;full-page image of the article</a>, posted ~13 minutes
                before the day's image.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Twitter account says "unbiased, fair, and logical news organization" (in the description), and is
                located in Emberton, Hale. These are, separately, real places in England. The only typos in the article
                are <code>expidetion</code> and <code>presteige</code> which have an 'e' in the wrong spot (possible
                link to the spelling below).
            </p>
            <h3>9.png (0.zip) &#128193;</h3>
            <p>
                This is the only post with accompanying text - <b>tomorrow</b>. It also broke the pattern of the
                characters for the secret message, but this is understandable as it was fully spelt out by the
                8<sup>th</sup>. If you read the characters in the background out left to right, you get
                <code>seead://hhh.awlypextypnclqe.nzx/aczupne/1-7483223/</code>.

                Looking at player data also shows <code>d0e628d4-40b6-4582-a1d5-4043c7dc6b48</code> (Ivory's

                The world, which was created in MC version 1.11 using the void preset, contains a small taiga
                platform

                the
                coords 8 114 6 lies a chest that contains a book. The book is 30 pages long and contains the
